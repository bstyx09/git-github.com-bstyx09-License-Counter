This program reads through an XML file with a list of all agent details for a Dynatrace server.
You can create this file by navigating to following URL:

https://<server address>:8021/rest/management/agents

Save the output from this somewhere on your computer as an xml file then run the command:


java -jar LicenseCounter.jar <xml file name>


This will then create a .csv file and a .txt file.
the .csv file can be edited with excel. This file shows the number of each type of agent per system profile.

the .txt file will list each agent name, its heap size, its agent group, and the total number of microservice jvms for each system profile.
